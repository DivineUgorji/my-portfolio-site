When I was getting started with Android development, one of the questions I had in my mind was where to get started. I observed that materials to study web development are everywhere but for mobile, the materials were either outdated or way above my league (the concepts in the content were not beginner-friendly). However, with time, a lot of searches, and engagement with the developer community, I was able to find a few materials that have helped and continue to help me in my mobile development journey starting with Android.



I am writing this article to help someone who is a complete beginner and looking for resources to start their journey in Android development. This is the article I wish I had when I was getting started and I hope it helps someone out there.


### Getting started


#### Pre-requisites

* To get started with Android development, you'll need a functioning computer system of at least 4GB of Ram so you can be able to run [Android Studio,](https://developer.android.com/studio) the Integrated development environment for developing Android apps.


### Resources to get started

I'd like to mention that there's no resource out there, that would take you from the beginning of your journey to an advanced level. Android ecosystem changes really fast and a lot of things get deprecated in this zone quickly. One can only gain experience in this terrain by experimenting and building apps.

First off, the official [Android documentation ](http://dev.nodeca.com) is the go-to for Android developers. However, it's not perfect. That is the reason I've created this list of resources to help one pull through.

### Scholarships
Google collaborated with Pluralsight and Andela to provide [learning opportunities](https://help.pluralsight.com/help/google-africa-developer-scholarship-2020) for developers resident in Africa. If you reside in Africa, you can follow Andela on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Andela) to be notified when opportunities call.


If you reside in the United States, Google has also partnered with Udacity to provide good [learning opportunities](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google)for free.


To get started with Java and Kotlin programming languages, check out these [course](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) series launched by Jetbrains Academy and Hyperskills which offers both theorems, quiz and hands-on practice projects.


### Books

### Communities


[Stack Overflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is the most popular QA website for developers. Every developer I know, has a room here, just sign up and start enjoying the goodness this community has to offer.


[r/android_devs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/android_devs/) - One of my most favorite communities. A place where all Android developers can speak openly and respectfully about the problems they encounter when developing and publishing applications. They give valuable tips, open constructive architectural discussions, discuss the present and future of programming in Android, and seek help when specialized sites do not provide solutions.


[r/androiddev/](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/) - Here, you'll find: - News for Android developers, thoughtful, informative articles, insightful talks, presentations, useful libraries, handy tools, and open-source applications for studying.

Another list of Android learning resources worth mentioning is this one created by 
[CodePath](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki)



These resources I listed barely scratch the surface of the vast resources for Android development out there. In this list, I tried to focus on free resources and the ones I have tried personally and found useful.


I hope this article helps someone to get started with Android development. If you found it useful, give it a thumbs-up, and share it with your friends and community. Also, watch this space for more content such as this.
