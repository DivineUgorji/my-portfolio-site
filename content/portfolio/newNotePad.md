shortDescription: Daily Diary And Journal, Free Notes App is a simple, easy to use minimalist notes app, built to understand the intergraton of the Android core Sdk and APIs, to illustrate the use of MVVM achitecture with Androidx libraries and to fully understand the development cycle of apps, from idea conceptualization, and development, to publishing on playstore.

## Tech Stack And Tools
This app is compatible with Android versio 5.0 and above.


[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.


[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..



[Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Android  Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.



[Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.



[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flowFlow ) - A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.



[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel )- Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.


[Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)- SQLite object mapping library.



[Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app



[DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.



Material Components for Android - Material Components are interactive building blocks for creating a user interface for Android.


[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool which is primarily web-based. The rough designs and mockups of this app was created using this tool.


Below is a demonstration of the working app.

This app makes use of MVVM achitecture pattern, which is recommended by google for Android apps to achieve separation of concerns between different components of the app and achieve loose coupling between the app's user interface and businees logic.




Below is a diagramatic representation of the achitectural pattern for this app.
