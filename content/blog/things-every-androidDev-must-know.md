In this article, I want to go through a list of skills and concepts that keep coming up on Android developer job boards and interviews that are essential for Android developers to be familiar with.

### Kotlin
[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.


Kotlin Application Deployment is faster to compile, lightweight, and prevents applications from increasing size. Any chunk of code written in Kotlin is much smaller compared to Java, as it is less verbose and less code means fewer bugs.

I have been writting Kotlin for some time now, and it's awesome.


It has a lot of features that helps you save a lot of time while coding and debugging, such as; Null safety, data classes, sealed classes, etc.



### Material Components

[Material Design](https://material.io/design) is a design language developed by Google in 2014. Expanding on the "cards" that debuted in Google Now, Material Design uses more grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows.

Material Design is an Android-oriented design language created by Google, supporting onscreen touch experiences via cue-rich features and natural motions that mimic real-world objects. Designers optimize users' experience with 3D effects, realistic lighting and animation features in immersive, platform-consistent GUIs.

### MVVM Achitectural Pattern

[Model–view–viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) is a software architectural pattern that facilitates the separation of the development of the graphical user interface – be it via a markup language or GUI code – from the development of the business logic or back-end logic so that the view is not dependent on any specific model platform.

MVVM Design Pattern: MVVM pattern supports two-way data binding between View and ViewModel. This allows automatic propagation of changes, inside the state of ViewModel to the View. Generally, the ViewModel utilizes the observer pattern to inform changes in the ViewModel to the Model.

### Testing Frameworks


[Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/fundamentals) is a very important practise in building digital products in the world today.
Testing helps you ensure the following in your apps;


Ensure quality control of your Android app.


Release apps with confidence to the Play Store.


Spend less time and money on bugs and errors.


Android offers many tools that help testers to effectively test the apps.


Enhance the customer experience.

### Agile methodolgies


Most companies work with Agile software development methodology these days. Essentially, Agile breaks each project into iterations that are also called sprints. Each sprint lasts an equal period of time (e.g. two weeks). During the sprint, the team works on a specific piece of functionality, which is released at the end. The exact implementation may vary depending on the company.


Having experience working in an Agile software development environment may complement your resume and work well for you during an interview for an Android developer job. If you have no experience like this, you should be at least familiar with the principles of Agile methodology.


This brings us to the close the close of this awesome blog post.
