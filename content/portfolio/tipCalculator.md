shortDescription: Tip calculator is a simple Android app built to understand the use of Kotlin programming language in Android development
---

This app can be run on Android version 5.0 and above.

This app is built with Kotlin 100%. The topics covered in building this app includes;



[Kotlin Values and Variables:](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/variable-types)
A variable is a location in memory (storage area) to hold data.
To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier)


[Kotlin Data Types:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-types.html)
In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that we can call member functions and properties on any variable. Some types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes. The basic types used in Kotlin: numbers, booleans, characters, strings, and arrays.


[Kotlin Functions:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html)
Kotlin functions are first-class, which means they can be stored in variables and data structures, and can be passed as arguments to and returned from other higher-order functions. You can perform any operations on functions that are possible for other non-function values.


[Kotlin Control flow:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html)
Control flow operators can be used to choose an appropriate path from two or more possible paths in computation. In this article, we will cover the following control flows in Kotlin: if expression. when expression. for loop.


[Kotlin Lamda Functions:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html)
Lambdas Expressions are essentially anonymous functions that we can treat as values – we can, for example, pass them as arguments to methods, return them, or do any other thing we could do with a normal object.


[Kotlin Higher Order Functions:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html)
A higher order function is a function that accepts or return another function. In Kotlin, functions are treated as first class citizens so you can assign them to variables and pass them to other functions as parameters. This can be achieved by using lambda expressions or function references.


[Kotlin Scoped Functions:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html)


[Kotlin Named and Default Arguments:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html)
In Kotlin, you can provide default values to parameters in function definition.
If the function is called with arguments passed, those arguments are used as parameters. However, if the function is called without passing argument(s), default arguments are used.

[Kotlin String Templates and Formating:](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/string)
String templates are String literals that contain embedded expressions. Unlike Java, many of Kotlin's constructs (but certainly, not all) are expressions. Notice that inside the curly brackets there's a valid Kotlin expression.


[Kotlin Null Safety and Elvis Operator:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html)
Kotlin's type system is aimed to eliminate the jeopardy of null reference from the code because it is a billion dollar mistake. Kotlin compiler also throws NullPointerException if it found any null reference without executing any other statements.


[Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Kotlin:](https://beginnersbook.com/2019/03/kotlin-class-and-objects-oop/)
Kotlin is an object oriented programming language just like Java. Object oriented programming (OOP) allows us to solve the complex problem by using objects. In this guide, we will learn what is a class, what is an object and several other features of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).


[Kotlin class constructors:](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/constructors)
A constructor is a concise way to initialize class properties.
It is a special member function that is called when an object is instantiated (created). However, how they work in Kotlin is slightly different.

In Kotlin, there are two constructors:

Primary constructor - concise way to initialize a class
Secondary constructor - allows you to put additional initialization logic


[Kotlin Init blocks:](https://blog.mindorks.com/understanding-init-block-in-kotlin)
The code inside the init block is the first to be executed when the class is instantiated. The init block is run every time the class is instantiated, with any kind of constructor as we shall see next. Multiple initializer blocks can be written in a class.



[Kotlin Nested Classes:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/nested-classes.html)
Similar like Java, Kotlin allows you to define a class within another class known as nested class.
Since Nested class is a member of its enclosing class Outer, you can use . notation to access Nested class and its members.



[Kotlin Data Class:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html)
The Kotlin language introduces the concept of Data Classes, which represent simple classes used as data containers and do not encapsulate any additional logic. Simply put, Kotlin’s solution enables us to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate code.



[Kotlin Sealed class:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/sealed-classes.html)
Sealed classes and interfaces represent restricted class hierarchies that provide more control over inheritance. All subclasses of a sealed class are known at compile time. ... A sealed class is abstract by itself, it cannot be instantiated directly and can have abstract members.



[Kotlin Companion Object:](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html)
A companion object is an object that's declared in the same file as a class , and has the same name as the class. A companion object and its class can access each other's private members. A companion object's apply method lets you create new instances of a class without using the new keyword.

Most of my learning on Kotlin programming language were done on Jetbrains academy, Kotlin documebtation, personal research with support from  
[Donn Felker's youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=887MNv283dc&list=PLVUm4IewkTXqwzuRXZisWg7shMTiQhUtz) on Kotlin programming language and Headfirst Kotlin book by David Griffiths and Dawn Griffiths. Published by O'Reilly.
